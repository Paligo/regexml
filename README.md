# regexml

This Rust workspace contains three related projects:

- [regexml](regexml/README.md) - an XML compliant regex implementation in Rust. This is used by the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee)

- [regexml-convert-perl-tests](regexml-convert-perl-tests/README.md) - converter scripts for
  particular XPath tests. Probably a one-off

- [regexml-ucd-blocks](regexml-ucd-blocks/README.md) - a script to maintain the
  `block.rs` module in the main `regexml` project.
